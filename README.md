# Open-Devin
Devin represents a self-governing entity ðŸ¤– dedicated to handling software engineering assignments with its command line interface, programming editor, and internet browser capabilities. This underscores the vast capabilities of LLMs within the field of software engineering, shining a light on new possibilities. The project aims to emulate, refine, and bring innovation to Devin's capabilities with the support of the open-source community.
